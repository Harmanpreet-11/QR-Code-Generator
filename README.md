# QR-Code-Generator
A code repo for my qr code generator project 

The project is very simple and uses the qr-code api to generate qr code's. The input text is passed upon the api and it convert's it into a qr code, very simple yet very 
effiecient. This is my very first project using the basic's of web development that is HTML , CSS AND JAVASCRIPT .

The code if free to use and no liscense is placed since many people might have already created it .
